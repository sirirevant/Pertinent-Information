## Topic : Gaming Machine
Need Statement : A new shopping mall which has opened in Hubballi is interested to have an innovative interactive robotic game in their gaming center. Though claw machine was mentioned by the client as an example, she is not very keen on that game machine.

## Observations

##### 1. Servo Motors

A servo motor is an electrical device which can push or rotate an object with great precision. If you want to rotate and object at some specific angles or distance, then you use servo motor. It is just made up of simple motor which run through servo mechanism



##### 2.	DC motor   

A DC motor is any of a class of rotary electrical machines that converts direct current electrical energy into mechanical energy. The most common types rely on the forces produced by magnetic fields. Nearly all types of DC motors have some internal mechanism, either electromechanical or electronic, to periodically change the direction of current in part of the motor.



##### 3.	Maze Labyrinth

A maze is a complex branching (multicursal) puzzle that includes choices of path and direction, may have multiple entrances and exits, and dead ends. A labyrinth is unicursal i.e. has only a single, non-branching path, which leads to the center then back out the same way, with only one entry/exit point.



##### 4.	Joystick

A joystick is an input device consisting of a stick that pivots on a base and reports its angle or direction to the device it is controlling.



##### 5.	Puzzle Games

A puzzle is a game, problem, or toy that tests a person's ingenuity or knowledge. In a puzzle, the solver is expected to put pieces together in a logical way, in order to arrive at the correct or fun solution of the puzzle. There are different genres of puzzles, such as crossword puzzles, word-search puzzles, number puzzles, relational puzzles, or logic puzzles.



## Estimated Cost
The estimated cost of existing solution may be Rs3000.
